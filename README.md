# HarvestClient 2.0

This is a fork from dmmikkel's harvest client.  In contrast this uses the Harvest JSON api (using Jax RS and Jackson/Jersey now) vs XML and also won't run into issues with empty datasets being returned from your queries to harvest.  It also does away with the  xxxCollection types that wrapped lists.  Now, you just deal with Java collections!

HarvestClient is an easy to use wrapper for the Harvest API.

It can currently only be used to fetch data from Harvest,
but will eventually support creating and updating data as well.

## Usage

Example that fetches all users:

    HarvestClientFactory factory = new HarvestClientFactory();
    HarvestClient client = factory.create("subdomain", "username", "password");
    List<User> users = client.getUsers();

    for (User user : users)
    {
        // Do something
    }

`subdomain` is the subdomain of your harvest account (e.g. https://**subdomain**.harvestapp.com
